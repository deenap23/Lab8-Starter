Graceful degregation refers to the practice of starting with maximal technology and then move to addressing lower levels with grace. In this lab we worked with service workers, which allowed our web app to continue to execute code while service workers handled network requests. These two are related. When creating web apps we can start with the main functionality, and then consider improvement with the use of service workers. Though the use of service workers enabled the use to PWA's and offline access, they are not universally supported. By starting with main functionality graceful degregation supports a broader functionality including those that dont support service workers.
